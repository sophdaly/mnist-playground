# mnist-playground


Playground for experimenting with neural nets and deep learning using Tensorflow.

## Contents

* Training ConvNets
* Saving and Restoring models
* ConvNets as Feature Extractors
* Projecting embeddings using Tensorboard

## Data 

* [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/): dataset of handwritten images following a standardized format

* [ZNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist): dataset of Zalando's fashion article images in MNIST format

* Download and extract datasets by running `make data`
